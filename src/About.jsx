        Research interest is increasingly focused on “deep” MRI scans of individual human brains, moving away from “wide” scans of numerous people. This shift is enabling the application of computer vision models to study human brain development more closely. With image databases like Common Objects in Context (COCO) already in use for training these models, there is now potential to fine-tune them on brain activity data as well.
        No image repository yet exists that views the experiences of children from their point of view.

        However, Sesame Street and other children’s shows offer rich material for this kind of resource. As educational television, Sesame Street naturally features more instances of numbers and words. Since it started creating episodes in 1969, it also has featured diverse groups and people of low socioeconomic status, with its high societal representation persisting today. Moreover, in the past 10 years, parents have played Sesame Street for their children much more than any other children’s show.

Initially funded by a NSF grant, this project transferred to a NIH grant because of its novelty in the field. It involves five research labs across three universities: University of Texas, Austin; University of Minnesota; and Vanderbilt University. Based at Vanderbilt, LAND Lab (author of this report) specializes in children’s reading and math development through MRI brain imaging. 
For this project, LAND Lab is creating a Sesame Street image corpus to study children’s brain development. With more than 4,500 episodes of at least 30 minutes each, Sesame Street provides LAND Lab tons of content to work with. A fine-tuned YOLO model trained on 4,000 of labeled images will allow us to label thousands of other Sesame Street frames.

      Three entities operate within the “Sesame Street” brand: (1) the Sesame Workshop, which bears rights to the film characters and generates new episodes in collaboration with (2) WGBH, mainly responsible for broadcasting and archiving episodes (along with AAPB); and (3) the Joan Gantz Cooney Center, researching ways to help children math. The five research labs involved in this project collaborate with Sesame Street.
